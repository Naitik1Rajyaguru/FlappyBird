# FlappyBird
Game created using Unity

Disclaimer :
- Game is created just for learning purpose, you can use it for your personal use if you like ! ‚ù§
- Developer have no harmful motive, thanks.

Motivation:
I created this simple Flappy Bird game as a learning project to delve into the basics of Unity and fundamental concepts of game development. The primary goal was to understand how to implement collision detection, gravity mechanics, movement controls, and key events within a game environment.

Game Description:
The game features a bird that flies across the screen, with the main objective being to navigate between continuously spawning pipes. Unlike the original Flappy Bird where the bird stays stationary and the pipes move, in this version, the bird flies on touch or click, and the pipes spawn continuously. The score increases as the bird successfully moves between the pipes, but the game ends if the bird touches any of the pipes.

Learnings:

Implementing basic physics concepts such as gravity and collision detection.
Understanding Unity's interface and workflow.
Handling user input through touch and click events.
Developing simple game logic to control character movements and scoring.
Additional Features to Consider:

Adding different difficulty levels by varying the speed and frequency of pipe spawning.
Introducing power-ups that temporarily alter the game's mechanics, such as invincibility or slow-motion.
Implementing a high-score system to encourage replayability.
Enhancing graphics and animations to create a more engaging visual experience.
Adding sound effects and background music to improve the overall game atmosphere.
